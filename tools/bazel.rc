# Test inherits all of the rules of build, so we need only specify many of
# our configuration options for build and they will also apply to test.

# Use 128 jobs to build. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any way to set
# the number of jobs to the number of actual cores on the machine (e.g., by
# looking at cpuinfo. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3814.
build --jobs 128

# # We have to use the monolithic build configuration of TF. See b/66853478.
# build --config=monolithic

# A timestamp is added to each message generated by Bazel specifying the time at
# which the message was displayed.
build --show_timestamps

# Print additional information when there's a failure.
build --verbose_failures

# Use CPP protos for python, not the reflection ones.
build --define=use_fast_cpp_protos=true

# Turn off meddlesome mostly false positive warnings. Unfortunately these only
# affect the Nucleus build itself, not our deps, which is where most of the
# problems are coming from.
#
# These are largely errors due to protobuf.size(). We want to see them in our
# own build.
# build --copt="-Wno-sign-compare"

# These are essentially all false positives from our CLIF bindings, we disable
# them in our own build.
# build --copt="-Wno-maybe-uninitialized"
# build --copt="-Wno-unused-function"

# These are errors coming from the protobuf library itself. We'd like to see
# them in our own build.
# build --copt="-Wno-write-strings"

# Errors sends combined stdout/stderr output from failed tests only into the
# stdout immediately after test is completed, ensuring that test output from
# simultaneous tests is not interleaved with each other. Prints a summary at the
# build as per summary output above.
# test --test_output=errors
